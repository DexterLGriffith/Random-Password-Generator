# Random-Password-Generator

This is a webpage that allows the user to generate a random password. For added security, the user defines which characters they wish to choose, and just how many overall characters they wish to have in the password. 

# Description   

The password generator given, did not function as intended. I will use my understanding of javascript, css and HTML semantics to reformat the existing code to allow for the user to select which criteria he/she wanted in their password and then generate for them a randomized, strong password to increase their security measures at work. I had to add different variables, add do while loops with if statements, as well as make sure the user is alerted when they dont meet the criteria.
